# MegaBake execution plan

Build the compiler in the numbered order below. Each step consumes an earlier result and produces a concrete implementation.

[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) defines the design. [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) defines acceptance checks. [north-star.md](north-star.md) fixes the scope.

## Start from the current checkout

The previous checklist records G0 workload, range-body, and mixed-runtime probes as complete for their declared target. Preserve that work. The completed entries and evidence remain at the end of this file.

The production package still has an empty `src/megabake/__init__.py`. Start at step 01 to connect live FX to the existing device work. Reuse the G0 implementations at steps 05, 09, and 13.

Function names and new file paths below are proposed implementation interfaces. Create each file when its step needs it. Keep two durable program representations: `ComputeGraph` and `KernelPlan`. Capture records, body configurations, and compiled artifacts hold metadata around them.

Unless a different root is shown, place new Python modules under `src/megabake`.

### The path you will build

```text
PyTorch model and live inputs
  -> Dynamo capture and pinned AOT/Inductor preparation
  -> live post-grad FX with its runtime contract
  -> ComputeGraph with typed tensor programs
  -> regions and valid body configurations
  -> tile maps, dependencies, phases, and storage
  -> KernelPlan
  -> generated CuTe DSL module
  -> compiled persistent kernel and runtime bindings
  -> callable returned through PyTorch's wrappers
```

### Working results along the way

| After step | You have |
| --- | --- |
| 01 | A backend that receives the required live FX graph |
| 04 | An imported graph with explicit computation, regions, and source references |
| 09 | Generic generators and a composable fast GEMM provider |
| 12 | A complete plan with layouts, dependencies, and storage |
| 15 | A small FX graph executing as one generated CuTe kernel |
| 16 | A complete MLP compiled through that path |
| 20 | Measured MLP performance after targeted optimization |
| 23 | Generic graph coverage and explicit external fallback |
| 29 | Complete transformer blocks in prefill and stateful decode |
| 31 | The complete captured model executing as one workload kernel |
| 33 | A documented compiler with complete-model correctness and performance evidence |

Use one small GEMM–elementwise–reduction fixture for steps 01–15. Keep a complete gated MLP as the next fixture. Add only the operations needed by those fixtures until step 20.

Use Mirage as the main implementation reference. The reuse table near the end maps steps to source components. Record source revisions, adaptations, comparisons, and required attribution with each port.

## 01. Get live post-grad FX through a real backend

**Input:** a PyTorch callable, example inputs, and the pinned PyTorch build.

**Implement in:** `frontend.py` and `fx_handler/export.py`, under `src/megabake`.

- [x] Implement `make_backend(**options)` as a Dynamo backend factory. Its returned backend accepts the Dynamo graph and example inputs.
- [x] Exercise that backend through `torch.compile(..., fullgraph=True)`.
- [x] Extract the preparation logic from [verify_smollm_fx.py](src/eager/verify_smollm_fx.py) into `fx_handler/export.py`; keep Hugging Face model capture in `fx_handler/transformers.py`.
- [x] Implement a handoff callback that receives the live prepared graph and binds its optimized FX forward without Inductor compilation.
- [x] Repair the cache-hit branch that currently labels an untransformed graph as post-grad. Keep capture-cache and compiled-plan reuse distinct.
- [x] Retain PyTorch's argument, output, guard, alias, and mutation wrappers. Keep Dynamo's guards active in their owning layer.
- [x] Return a reference callable initially. Record its execution as reference execution until step 15 replaces it.

**Output:** live post-grad FX plus a capture context with input order, metadata, output structure, and runtime requirements.

**Check:** run cache-hit and cache-miss cases through the backend. Change inputs and parameters. Both paths must use the intended graph phase and preserve outputs.

## 02. Import FX into the Compute Graph

**Input:** the live graph and capture context from step 01.

**Implement in:** `graph.py`, with `import_fx(graph, context) -> ComputeGraph`.

- [ ] Assign stable IDs to source nodes and tensor results. Flatten boundary tuples while retaining the output reconstruction map.
- [ ] Import each placeholder in runtime argument order. Represent parameters as live bindings.
- [ ] Import every operation, including unknown targets. Keep source locations and original FX nodes for diagnostics.
- [ ] Store shapes, dtypes, devices, boundary strides, aliases, and known effects. Keep value identity separate from storage identity.
- [ ] Derive producer/use lists. Add a graph verifier for missing operands, invalid outputs, cycles, and inconsistent metadata.

Use these records as the starting schema:

```text
Value:  id, shape, dtype, device, strides, storage relation
Op:     id, source FX IDs, operands, results, attributes,
        tensor program if known, effects, numerical rules
Region: source op IDs, external inputs, live outputs, semantic facts
Graph:  values, ops, regions, inputs, outputs, runtime context
```

**Output:** a `ComputeGraph` that accounts for every captured input, operation, output, and effect.

- [ ] Add exact semantic annotations only where a matcher succeeds. Keep unmatched operations available for generic lowering.
- [ ] Verify that region coverage includes every source operation and preserves effect ordering.

**Output:** baseline regions that body providers can inspect.

- [ ] Support reductions larger than a single loaded tile. Keep barriers consistent across participating threads.
- [ ] Add partial-result and merge phases only where the numerical policy allows them. Describe both phases in the plan.

**Output:** reusable reduction schedules that generate different norms and reductions from their source expressions.

**Input:** selected body accesses, source dependencies, aliases, and effects.

**Implement in:** `schedule.py`, with `derive_dependencies(selection)` and `make_phase_schedule(selection, dependencies)`.

- [ ] Add producer-to-consumer dependencies for every required value. Include all input tiles needed by each reduction.
- [ ] Add write-after-read and write-after-write ordering for state or reused source storage.
- [ ] For irregular accesses, use a conservative domain when exact analysis is unavailable.

- [ ] Retain arbitrary prerequisite sets in the plan. Keep operation names independent of runtime event encoding.

**Output:** an executable phase order with explicit work assignments and dependencies.

**Check:** simulate the schedule on small fixtures. Verify a fork/join graph, a view, and a down projection needing several producer tiles.

## 12. Assign storage and finish the KernelPlan

**Input:** the scheduled work and all live values.

**Implement in:** `memory.py`, with `assign_storage(plan)`, and `KernelPlan` in `plan.py`.

## 13. Turn the G0 runtime into a reusable phase runner

**Input:** the phase schedule, worker scratch, and launch requirements.

**Implement in:** `runtime.py`, using [mixed_body_probe.py](experiments/g0_2026_10_09/mixed_body_probe.py).

- [ ] Extract the cooperative worker loop and its release/acquire barrier into reusable device functions.

- [ ] Define per-invocation state ownership and the epoch lifecycle. Prevent stale completion values from satisfying a later phase.
- [ ] Retain the proved eager-call epoch path initially. Check capacity and overflow before launch, and keep concurrent invocations isolated.
- [ ] Account for initial state setup and any recurring reset. Required recurring GPU work must stay inside the workload kernel.
- [ ] Keep CUDA Graph capture unsupported until replay can advance synchronization state correctly. Add an explicit admission check.

**Output:** a runtime that executes any admitted phase plan using the existing cooperative mechanism.

**Check:** port the delayed-producer, idle-worker, changed-binding, and largest-grid cases. Preserve the G0 probe's declared limits.

## 14. Emit a complete CuTe DSL module from KernelPlan

**Implement in:** `compiler.py`, with `compile_post_grad`, `compile_plan`, and `bind_callable`.

- [ ] Wire steps 02–14 into the callback installed at step 01.
- [ ] Compile the complete kernel. Query registers, shared memory, local memory, active blocks, and cooperative launch limits.

## 21. Cache compiled plans while retaining live bindings

**Input:** measured plans, compiled kernels, and their guarded runtime contracts.

- [ ] In fallback mode, delegate the whole captured invocation through a pinned Inductor adapter without recursively entering MegaBake.
- [ ] Retain the same runtime wrappers, guards, outputs, aliases, and state behavior.
- [ ] Label the result `inductor_fallback` and record its reason and launch count.
- [ ] Keep runtime device errors separate from compile rejection. Never retry a partly executed stateful invocation through fallback.

## 28. Lower KV state access and updates

**Input:** a stateful captured invocation and its explicit cache bindings.

**Implement in:** `lowering.py`, `memory.py`, and the attention provider.

- [ ] Start with a bounded contiguous cache. Define capacity, valid length, layout, storage identity, and update ranges.

**Implement in:** `src/megabake/__init__.py` and a small example/benchmark entry point.

- [ ] Export the implemented `make_backend` API and document supported options, software pins, and hardware requirements.
- [ ] Add a runner with model/revision, input shape, `--mode prefill|decode`, and explicit fallback options.
- [ ] Make the runner compile, check, and benchmark the same declared invocation.
- [ ] Write graph/plan dumps, source references, chosen bodies, resources, launch count, correctness, and timing results.
- [ ] Document unsupported cases and generic-body performance gaps. Keep external fallback clearly labeled.

The intended public use is:

```python
# Target API to implement; this is not available in the current checkout.
compiled_model = torch.compile(
    model,
    backend=megabake.make_backend(mode="prefill", fallback="error"),
    fullgraph=True,
)
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = compiled_model(*inputs)
```

**Output:** a reproducible entry point that a user can run without editing compiler internals.

**Check:** run from a fresh process. Change weights and inputs, trigger a guard miss, and check strict and explicit fallback behavior.

## 33. Complete the model validation and performance report

**Input:** the public path, declared target matrix, and equivalent baselines.

**Implement in:** the regression fixtures and benchmark runner.

- [ ] Run complete prefill and advancing decode cases for the declared shapes and GPU resources.
- [ ] Check outputs, state, aliases, mutations, changed bindings, and numerical tolerances fixed before measurement.
- [ ] Confirm one recurring workload launch for each claimed megakernel result.
- [ ] Measure complete-call and GPU latency against equivalent `torch.compile` and any stronger measured baseline.
- [ ] Report raw samples, launch traces, resources, workspace, compilation, setup, and first-call costs.
- [ ] Require an improvement beyond measurement noise for each claimed performance success. Keep failures visible and fix their dominant cause.
- [ ] Run retained generic-coverage, norm-variant, attention, fallback, cache, and synchronization regressions.
- [ ] Publish the support matrix and commands. Link every completion claim to its saved evidence.

**Output:** the architecture implemented for the declared targets, with reproducible complete-model evidence.

**Check:** full-model correctness establishes support. The performance objective is complete only for targets that pass the complete-model comparison.

## Mirage source map for this sequence

Use the pinned source links and restrictions in [SCHEDULER_REUSE.md](SCHEDULER_REUSE.md). Inspect connected passes before adapting a helper.

| --- | --- | --- |
| 02–04 | Graph/tensor representations and transpiler pass order | Tensor meaning, source ownership, and transformation checks |
| 06–08, 17, 24 | Threadblock primitives, epilogues, `resolve_tb_fusion.cc` | Generated expressions, reusable schedules, and legal local fusion |
| 09, 26 | Hopper GEMM and attention device bodies | Pipeline structure, scratch ownership, and repeated-entry tests |
| 10 | Tile-layout adapter, `sched_tb_graph.cc`, Hopper swizzle planning | Offset mapping, copy checks, and instruction/layout compatibility |
| 11, 19 | `annotated_graph.cc`, `runtime.cc` | Dependency grouping, descriptors, and complete task simulation |
| 12, 30 | `plan_dtensor_memory.cc`, `plan_stensor_memory.cc` | Allocation algorithms supplied with MegaBake's verified lifetimes |
| 13, 19 | Persistent worker runtime and atomics | Publication, work dispatch, and progress under the one-kernel contract |
| 14, 30 | Task variant registration | Reuse code by program/configuration and bind tensors through data |
| 18 | `dim_strategy.cc`, layout constraints | Bounded candidate generation tied to provider capabilities |
| 20, 29, 33 | Device profiler and runtime tests | Find waits, preserve attribution, and measure final latency without instrumentation |

## Additional changes when a measured target needs them

Apply these changes in the responsible step and repeat its complete-workload check.

| Measured problem | Implement in | Concrete change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Too few GEMM tiles | Steps 09 and 18 | Add a smaller tile or split reduction with explicit partial storage and numerical checks |
| Unbalanced ready work | Step 19 | Add bounded task claiming with unique ownership, queue limits, fairness, and termination |
| Weight-load stalls | Steps 09, 13, and 19 | Prefetch between compatible ranges with explicit buffer ownership and completion |
| Decode attention lacks parallelism | Steps 26–28 | Split context and emit a merge with stable softmax statistics |
| Cluster multicast can reduce traffic | Steps 05, 09, and 15 | Add a cluster body with explicit collective scope, occupancy, and launch admission |
| CUDA Graph replay is required | Steps 13, 15, and 21 | Make epoch/reset state advance during replay; test repeated replay without host epoch updates |

## Relationship to the acceptance gates

The numbered steps define execution order. Gates record evidence for the resulting implementation.

| Gate | Where its implementation is assembled and checked |
| --- | --- |
| G0 | Existing probes, then production integration in steps 05–15 |
| G1 | Complete MLP construction and improvement in steps 16–20 |
| G2 | Thin frontend in steps 01–04; integrated compiler and general coverage through step 23 |
| G3 | Norm, attention, mode, and state work in steps 24–29 |
| G4 | Model scaling, full invocation, public entry, and evidence in steps 30–33 |
| G5 | Targeted body, event, storage, and search changes at the step that needs them |

Start the thin frontend now. Keep early fixtures small. Use G1 to control expansion into broad operator and model coverage.

## Previously completed probe work

The entries below retain the completed work from the previous checklist. Their task numbers refer to that checklist. They describe probe results; production integration has separate checks above.

### Recorded task 01. Fix the first workload and measurement setup

**Gate: G0. Start here.**

- [x] Select the GPU target and pin the software versions. Record the actual SM count and cooperative-launch support.
- [x] Pin the first model checkpoint. Declare outputs, precision, numerical tolerances, and required state updates.
- [x] Extract actual projection shapes and strides. Include gate/up/down, Q/K/V, output projection, and the vocabulary head.
- [x] Select small-M and larger-M fixtures, partial tiles, and weight sets below and above L2 capacity.
- [x] Record separate prefill and stateful decode fixtures. Keep their shapes and cache requirements available from the start.
- [x] Reproduce library GEMM and complete MLP baselines. Record effective Inductor choices and whether autotuning ran.
- [x] Make one measurement harness report numerical errors, raw timings, launch count, and compiled resource use.
- [x] Separate setup, compilation, first-call, warm GPU, and complete host-call timing. Include a weight-streaming case.

**Deliverable:** complete. See [WORKLOAD.md](experiments/g0_2026_10_09/WORKLOAD.md), [g0_workload.json](experiments/g0_2026_10_09/g0_workload.json), the saved GEMM reports, and [mlp_baseline.json](experiments/g0_2026_10_09/mlp_baseline.json).

### Recorded task 02. Make a fast GEMM body process a range of tiles

**Gate: G0. Requires task 01.**

- [x] Select a measured official CuTe GEMM configuration for each initial regime. Retain its original launch as a reference.
- [x] Extract device work behind the proposed `run(work_iterator, tensor_bindings, scratch, epilogue)` interface.
- [x] Keep the pipeline active across the assigned tile range. Allocate reusable scratch in the enclosing worker.
- [x] State thread participation, warp roles, barrier state, output readiness, and scratch-release conditions.
- [x] Bind current addresses and descriptors on each call. Check repeated entry with changed tensors, contents, and tile counts.
- [x] Compare the original launch, the range entry, and the restarting adapter. Record latency and resources for each.

**Deliverable:** complete. See [resident_range_probe.py](experiments/g0_2026_10_09/resident_range_probe.py) and [resident_range.json](experiments/g0_2026_10_09/resident_range.json) for the range contract, correctness, resource use, and comparison timings.

### Recorded task 03. Run different bodies inside one persistent kernel

**Gate: G0. Requires task 02.**

- [x] Generate a small vector body and a reduction body from typed expressions. Include different casts or scalar parameters.
- [x] Run GEMM, generated work, and the next required GEMM configuration inside one kernel.
- [x] Start with a manually specified phase plan and distinct intermediate buffers.
- [x] Implement and test the actual cooperative launch and grid barrier in CuTe DSL. Include workers with no assigned tiles.
- [x] Derive the worker limit from the compiled complete kernel. Reject an oversized launch before execution.
- [x] Check cross-CTA data visibility, asynchronous completion, scratch reuse, and transitions between warp roles.
- [x] Keep per-call state private. Include required initialization inside the workload kernel.
- [x] Test repeated calls, changed bindings, delayed producers, and the largest valid worker grid.
- [x] Run the relevant memory/race checks. Save the launch trace and complete resource report.

**Deliverable:** complete for the G0 probe. The cooperative M=4 kernel passes repeated changed bindings and delayed producers at the compiled 60-worker limit; repeated M=4→1 and M=4→256 rebinds also pass. A 61-worker request is rejected before the workload launch. The trace contains one kernel, and memcheck, racecheck, and synccheck are clean at 60 workers. CUDA Graph replay is outside this probe; tested calls supply their barrier epochs on the host.
